## Employee-Tracker 

## Description
This Employee Management System is a command-line application designed for business owners to efficiently view and manage departments, roles, and employees within their company. 

The motivation behind this project is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows business owners to organize and plan their business operations effectively. 
I built this Employee Management System to address the need for business owners to efficiently organize and manage their company's departments, roles, and employees.
This project solves the problem of manual and cumbersome management of organizational data for business owners. By offering a command-line application with intuitive options, it enables users to perform tasks such as viewing department information, adding new roles, and updating employee roles seamlessly. The system streamlines data organization and enhances productivity by providing quick access to critical business information.
Through developing this Employee Management System, I gained valuable experience in the following areas:

Database Management: Setting up and interacting with MySQL databases using Node.js.
Command-Line Interface (CLI) Development: Creating interactive command-line applications using libraries like inquirer.js to handle user input and output effectively.
Data Manipulation: Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database records from a Node.js environment.
Project Structure and Organization: Designing a modular project structure for scalability and maintainability.
Error Handling and Validation: Implementing error handling and input validation to enhance application robustness.

## Key Features and Functions:
View all departments, roles, and employees
Add new departments, roles, and employees
Update an employee's role within the company
Through a series of user prompts and input options, this application simplifies the task of managing essential business data, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
